									<h1>Project 1: <br>Technology Trend Analysis</h1>
									</header>
									<p><Center> <h2>March 2024 </h2> <h2>Project Goal: Discover what programming languages, 
										database skills, and web frames are the most in demand using data from job postings
										and surveys.</h2></Center>

									<!--Introduction Section-->
									<p><u><b>Introduction</b></u><br> This case study resembles the work a Junior Data Analyst would do for a global IT 
										and business consulting services firm that is known for its expertise in IT solutions. To keep pace with changing 
										technologies and remain competitive, this organization regularly analyzes data to help identify 
										future skill requirements. I determined these future skill requirments using data from the 2019 Stackoverflow developer survey, web scraping, and web APIs. This analysis is split into six sections: <b>Ask, Prepare, 
										Process, Analyze, Vizualize, and Act</b>. The scripts I created for this analysis can be found here: <a href="https://github.com/AlexanderVandenberg/Technology-Trend-Analysis" target="_blank"> Jupyter Notebook files </a>.<br /></p>

									<!--Ask Section-->
									<p><u><b>Ask</b></u> <br><b>What programming languages, database skills, and Web Frames are the 
										most popular now and are likely to be popular to the future?</b> Properly understanding technology trends is vital in the 
										digital age because it has historically given companies a competetive advantage.</p>
										
									<!--Prepare Section-->
									<p><u><b>Prepare</b></u> <br>
									I used Beautiful Soup web scraping to find average annual salary by technology, and a web API to find number of jobs by location and technology. 
									After importing this data to a pandas dataframe, I used Openpyxl to convert the dataframes to Excel files. These Excel files were used to create the 
									Number of Jobs by City, Number of Jobs by Technology, and Average Annual Salary by Technology bar graphs in the <b>share</b> section. 
									Finally I created a data frame from the 2019 Stackoverflow developer survey data, which will be used in the <b>analyze</b> section.
									</p>
									
									<!--Process Section-->
									<p><u><b>Process</b></u> <br>
									I started cleaning the Stackoverflow data by deleting duplicate rows using the drop_duplicates function.
									I found missing values in the "Work Location" column using np.nan and replaced them with the most frequent value in the column. 
									Finally, the compensation column was inconsistant because it contained weekly, monthly, and annual compensation.
									I fixed this problem by creating a "normalized annual compensation" column that multiplyed weekly compensation by 50 (assuming two weeks of holidays per year), 
									monthly compensation by 12, and kept annual compensation the same.
									
									<!--Analyze Section-->
									<p><u><b>Analyze</b></u> <br>
									After cleaning the data, I used histograms and box plots to understand the distribution of annual salary and age for survey respondents.

										<img src="images/Age Histogram.png" alt="" style="width:100%">
										<figcaption>The respondent ages are centered around 29, and most fall between 20 and 40. 
											The minimum age is 16, lower quartile is 25,  median is 29, upper quartile is 35, upper bound is 50, and maximum is 99.</figcaption>

									<figcaption> Salaries are centered at $57,000, with most falling between $0 and $200,000. There are also a lot of outliers at the $1M and $2M marks. 
										The minimum annual salary is $0, lower quartile is $26,169, median is $57,000, upper quartile is $95,000, upper bound is $200,000 and maximum is $2,000,000.</figcaption>

									I started making visualizations by creating bar charts from the Excel files created with Openpyxl.

									After generating the three bar graphs in Excel, I created <a href="https://us1.ca.analytics.ibm.com/bi/?perspective=dashboard&pathRef=.my_folders%2FCapstone&action=view&mode=dashboard&subView=model0000018dd74b515b_00000000" target="_blank">

									<!--Act Section-->
									<p><u><b>Act</b></u> <br>The top four findings based on my analysis:
										<ol>
											<li>JavaScript is the leading programming language, but Python is close to surpasing JavaScript. 
												TypeScript is also fast growing, and could potentially convert JavaScript users.</li>
											<li>MySQL is the most popular database, and PostSQL and MongoDB are gaining popularity. 
												Microsoft SQL Server and SQLite should be avoided due to decreasing popularity.  </li>
											<li>JQuery, React.js, and Angular/Angular.js are the most popular webframes, 
												but JQuery's growth seems to be stagnating.</li>
											<li>Linux and Windows are the most popular platforms, and Docker is quickly approaching them in popularity.</li>
