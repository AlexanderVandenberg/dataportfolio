									<h1>Project 1: <br>Technology Trend Analysis</h1>
									</header>
									<p><Center> <h2>March 2024 </h2> <h2>Project Goal: Discover what programming languages, 
										database skills, and web frames are the most in demand using data from job postings
										and surveys.</h2></Center>

									<!--Introduction Section-->
									<p><u><b>Introduction</b></u><br> This case study resembles the work a Junior Data Analyst would do for a global IT 
										and business consulting services firm that is known for its expertise in IT solutions. To keep pace with changing 
										technologies and remain competitive, this organization regularly analyzes data to help identify 
										future skill requirements. I determined these future skill requirments using the six data analysis steps: <b>Ask, Prepare, 
										Process, Analyze, Vizualize, and Act</b>. The Jupyter Notebook files I created this analysis can be found <a href="https://github.com/AlexanderVandenberg/Technology-Trend-Analysis" target="_blank"> here </a>.<br /></p>	
									
									<!--Ask Section-->
									<p><u><b>Ask</b></u> <br><b>What programming languages, database skills, and Web Frames are the 
										most popular now and are likely to be popular to the future?</b> Properly understanding technology trends is vital in the 
										digital age because it has historically given companies a competetive advantage.</p>
										
									<!--Prepare Section-->
									<p><u><b>Prepare</b></u> <br>
									I used Beautiful Soup web scraping to find average annual salary by technology, and a web API to find number of jobs by location and technology. 
									After importing this data to a pandas dataframe, I used Openpyxl to convert the dataframes to Excel files. These Excel files were used to create the 
									Number of Jobs by City, Number of Jobs by Technology, and Average Annual Salary by Technology bar graphs in the share section. 
									Finally I created a data frame from a Stackoverflow developer survey, that will be used in the analyze section.
									</p>
									
									<!--Process Section-->
									<p><u><b>Process</b></u> <br>
									I started cleaning the Stackoverflow data by deleting duplicate rows using the drop_duplicates function.
									I found missing values in the "Work Location" column using np.nan and replaced them with the most frequent value in the column. 
									Finally, the compensation column was inconsistant because it contained weekly, monthly, and annual compensation.
									I fixed this problem by creating a "normalized annual compensation" column that multiplyed weekly compensation by 50, 
									monthly compensation by 12, and kept annual compensation the same.
									
									<!--Analyze Section-->
									<p><u><b>Analyze</b></u> <br>
									After cleaning the data, I used histograms and box plots to understand the distribution of annual salary and age for survey respondents.

									<p><u><b>Act</b></u> <br>The top four findings based on my analysis:
										<ol>
											<li>JavaScript is the leading programming language, but Python is close to surpasing JavaScript. 
												TypeScript is also fast growing, and could potentially convert JavaScript users.</li>
											<li>MySQL is the most popular database, and PostSQL and MongoDB are gaining popularity. 
												Microsoft SQL Server and SQLite should be avoided due to decreasing popularity.  </li>
											<li>JQuery, React.js, and Angular/Angular.js are the most popular webframes, 
												but JQuery's growth seems to be stagnating.</li>
											<li>Linux and Windows are the most popular platforms, and Docker is quickly approaching them in popularity.</li>

									<h1>Project 2: <br> Cyclistic Case Study</h1>
									
									</header>

									<p><Center> <h2>August 2022 </h2> <h2>Project Goal: To determine how annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently </h2></Center>

									<p><u><b>Introduction:</b></u> This case study is for the Google Data Analytics Capstone course and is based on data from Cyclistic, 
										a Chicago based bikeshare company.  
										The study follows the six data analysis steps: <b>Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyze, Visualize, Act</b>.
									The raw data can be found <a href="documents/Cyclistic Raw Data.csv" target="_blank">here</a> and the post-analysis excel spreasheet can be found <a href="documents/Cyclistic Data Analysis.xlsx" target="_blank">here</a>.<br /></p>

									<div class="image main"><img src="images/logo.jpg" alt="" /></div>
									
									<!--Ask Section-->
									<p><u><b>Ask</b></u> <br> Cyclistic has casual riders that pay a small fee for each ride and members 
										who pay an annual fee for unlimited rides. The question for this analysis is <b>how do annual 
										members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently</b>? This answer to this question can be 
										used to encourage more casual riders to switch to annual members, ultimately generating more revenue.</p>

									<!--Prepare Section-->
									<p><u><b>Prepare</b></u> <br>The data to be analyzed is from .csv file that contains data for Cyclistic trips 
										for January 2022. This is a first party source since it comes from directly from Cyclistic. It is a comprehensive list 
										all 103,770 trips for the month of January. To prepare the data for analysis, I converted the file to a .xlsx file.   </p>

										
									<!--Process Section-->
									<p><u><b>Process</b></u> <br>I created column E, "ride_length", by subtracting the start time from the end time and changing to the 
										time format. I also created column F, "day_of_week", using the TEXT function on the "started_at" column. I cleaned the data by 
										using a filter that only just includes rows with rides lasting zero or less minutes and deleting them.  </p>

									<center>
										<figure>
										<img src="images/process.jpg" alt="" style="width:80%">
										<figcaption>Snapshots of the columns I added.</figcaption>
									</figure></center>

									<p><br></p>
									
									<!--Analyze Section-->
									<p><u><b>Analyze</b></u> <br>I created the following pivot tables to aggregate the data:</p>
									
									<center>
									<figure>
										<img src="images/Analyze_1.jpg" alt="" style="width:80%">
										<figcaption>Pivot table 1: lists the number of rides that occured on each day of the week by 
											member type. It also displays the percentage of rides that were member or casual occuring on each day of the week.  </figcaption>
									</figure></center>

									<p><br></p>
									
									<center>
									<figure>
										<img src="images/Analyze_2.jpg" alt="" style="width:80%">
										<figcaption>Pivot table 2: lists the average ride lengths in minutes during each day of the week by memeber type. </figcaption>
									</figure></center>
									
									<p><br></p>

									<center>
									<figure>
										<img src="images/Analyze_3.png" alt="" style="width:50%">
										<figcaption>Pivot Table 3: lists the average ride lengths in minutes during each day of the week by memeber type. </figcaption>
									</figure></center>

									<p><br></p>

									<!--Share Section-->
									<p><u><b>Share</b></u> <br>I created graphs from the pivot tables to gain insights from the data:</p>

									<center>
									<figure>
										<img src="images/Share_1.jpg" alt="" style="width:80%">
										<figcaption>The number of casual rides is similar for every weekday, except for a spike on Saturday. This could be 
											because most people have more free time to ride casually on Saturdays. In contrast, members tend to ride more on weekdays, 
											because they more frequently use bikes to get to work or regular weekday events. In addition, members ride much more often 
											than casual users because members pay a flat fee for the month while casuals have to pay for every ride. 
											</figcaption>
									</figure></center>


									<p><br></p>
									
									<center>
									<figure>
										<img src="images/Share_2.png" alt="" style="width:60%">
										<figcaption> Despite the vast majority of riders being members, over one third of the total ride time is by casuals. 
											These pie charts demostrate that casuals ride less frequently and for longer than members.</figcaption>
									</figure></p></center>
										
									<p><br></p>
									
									<center>
									<figure>
										<img src="images/Share_3.jpg" alt="" style="width:80%">
										<figcaption>Casual riders tend to ride for two to three times as long as members. This may be because casual riders have to 
											pay for each ride and want to make the most of each trip. Inversely, members tend to ride more frequently for less 
											time per ride, because they pay a flat fee no matter how many trips they take. Casual rider's trip durations also vary much more depending on the day of the week than members. This can be due to 
											members having consistent routes to work or school that they frequently ride.</figcaption>
									</figure></center>

									<p><br></p>
									
									<center>
									<figure>
										<img src="images/Share_4.jpg" alt="" style="width:50%">
										<figcaption>Casual riders more frequently use electric bikes than classic bikes, 
											while members use more classic bikes than electric bikes.</figcaption>

									<center><p><h2>Cyclistic Membership Dashboard</h2></p></center>
									<center><figure>
										<img src="images/Cyclistic Dashboard.png" alt="" style="width:90%">
										<figcaption>Finally, I used Tableau to organize these visualizations into an interactive dashboard 
											that can be found <a href="https://prod-useast-b.online.tableau.com/t/vonvandenberg468cf32aa3/views/CyclisticCaseStudy/Dashboard?:origin=card_share_link&:embed=n" target="_blank">here.</a>
										</figcaption>
									</figure></center></p>

									<!--Act Section-->
									<p><u><b>Act</b></u> <br>The top three recommendations based on my analysis:
										<ol>
											<li>Because memberships are more popular on weekdays than weekends, advertise memberships as a less expensive way to get to work than driving.</li>
											<li>Offer a cheaper membership that only allows the customer to ride on the weekends. The weekend membership would target the relatively 
												large amount of casual riders that ride on weekends.  </li>
											<li>Instead of charging one fee per ride, charge casual rides by a smaller fee per minute of riding. This time based fee insentivises people to get a membership if they 
												would like to ride for a longer time without penalty.</li>
										  </ol>
